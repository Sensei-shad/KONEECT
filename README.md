Don't forget to open the conf_001 folder with vscode

Next install these extensions in vscode: ------
ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets - by *dsznajder
Tailwind CSS Intellisense - by *Tailwind Labs
vscode-icons - by *VSCode Icons Team [go to the extension and set the icon pack active, TOTALLY OPTIONAL]

TO RUN IT LOCALLY
npm run dev (while inside the project using powershell or inside the VSCODE TERMINAL)

Very Important Note:-
Ofcourse I deleted my stream and clerk api key and api secret. Open account put your secret key in the .env.local file and run it. So that you can have full control over the project and your account. All you need to do is open account and put your key and secret and rest of the work of the clerk section of the video is done already. Refer to these ---->>
